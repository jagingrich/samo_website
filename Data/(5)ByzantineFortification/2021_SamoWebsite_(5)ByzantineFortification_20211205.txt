The fortification seems to have first served a military purpose for about a century before it was later repurposed as a domestic building with the construction of additional walls.  Caption: (Left) Detail of reused limestone blocks (Right) Detail of reused marble blocks. © American Excavations SamothraceThe fortification’s foundations and walls were visible and accessible in the 19th century and was even identified as a labyrinth by the Austrian team. The French-Czech expedition excavated the structure in 1923 and 1927 and, after identifying the medieval date of construction, intentionally destroyed parts of the fortification in a quest to recover the ancient materials embedded within it. During excavations in 1965, the American team cleaned and stabilized the building. Selected Bibliography: Lehmann, K. 1998. Samothrace: A Guide to the Excavations and the Museum, 6th ed., rev.
